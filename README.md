# Restaurant

## What is this project?
- This project is part of the Odin project curriculum
- Goal was to make everything with Webpack and only javascript (no HTML)

## Additional things
- I made everything responsive

## What did I learn:
- What is npm actually
- Basic npm commands
- How to install and configure Webpack
- How to use Webpack
- Better DOM manipulation skills
- Improved my overall knowledge as a web dev
### Edit: 
- I also learned how to deploy my site to github pages when having multiple folders and using webpack! (had quite a bit of problems with this, so I wanted to mention it!)

## What am I proud of:
- I felt a lot more confident coding and some tasks that took me a long to finish before, I do easily now
- Finished this project fastly (at least comparing to previous similar projects)
